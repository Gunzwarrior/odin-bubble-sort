This is my attempt at the fourth project of The Odin Project Ruby course : Bubble sort

I have to make a method that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?)

> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
